# RayTracing_HW
This is the homework files of cis summer program.
Implemented: ray-triangle test, Sphere-triangle test, Shading, Tracing  
Problems occured:  
Was in trouble of calculating refraction. Solve by learning from a blog.  
What I learned:  
Basic ray tracing technique and some vector calculations.   
Future plans:  
Write a GPU version using CUDA, which will be much more faster.
