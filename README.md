# RayTracing_HW
This is the homework files of cis summer program.
Implemented:
1. ray-triangle test
2. Sphere-triangle test
3. Shading
4. Tracing
Problems occured:
Was in trouble of calculating refraction. Solve by learning from a blog.
What I learned:
Basic ray tracing technique and some vector calculations. 
Future plans:
Write a GPU version using CUDA, which will be much more faster.
